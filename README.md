Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated
fashion using a computer program. It's a useful technique for creating datasets for research
and learning. Follow these steps to build a web scraping project from scratch using Python
and its ecosystem of libraries.
Scrape the data out of the website and save the data either in the CSV or Excel file. Also use
the Pandas library to use the scrapped data into a Data Frame.
The two web scraping libraries that will help smooth this projectâ€™s implementation is
Beautiful Soup and Requests of the Python programming language. They allow easy access to
websites and parsing of HTML pages.
